# GitHub account setup

To contribute changes or additions to Adobe (or other organizations) documentation on GitHub, you need to set up your own GitHub account. It's easy.

1. If you don't already have a GitHub account, go to https://github.com/joinï»¿.
1. Follow the prompts to create your account. 
1. If you're unfamiliar with GitHub, go through the tutorial at the end of the setup process.

Identify any affilations in your GitHub profile. Identification helps us build a complete profile of all your activitives.

> [!NOTE] 
>If you are an Adobe employee, we recommend that you go to https://git.corp.adobe.com/adobedocs, sign in using your LDAP account, and locate the content you want to edit. You can then use either the minor (in-browser) or major (forking and local closing) approach to editing articles and submitting pull requests.
